             <p>
                Hello, My name is Akshay Shivkumar. I am a sophomore
                Computer Science Major at the University of Maryland-College Park.
                I plan on pursuing a math minor in addition to my intended Major
                of Computer Science. Outside of school, I am broadening my education
                by learning Python and working to become a full stack developer. I am currently 
                working on a project involving Wilson's algorithm to implement a Maze Generation
                project in python to further develop my experience in the language. In the future,
                I hope to take machine learning classes as I am interested in this topic, and believe
                 that it will vastly change the world in years to come. In school, I am currently taking
                 linear algebra and learning C, having already completed the object oriented classes and 
                 discrete math. I am always looking to grow as a programmer and hope to one day work in the industry.
            </p>
